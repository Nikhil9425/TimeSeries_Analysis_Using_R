# Time Series Analysis of Seasonal and Non Seasonal Data

## Seasonal 
Motivated by the desire to project the financial solvency of Social Security, the 
idea is to discuss forecasts of labor force participation rates. The purpose of this 
project is to give a structure to the problem of forecasting labor force participation 
rates, to summarize the data and to show how to implement seasonal ARIMA 
model. In summarizing the data, we find that differencing rates captures much of 
the dynamic movement of rates, as measured by short-range out-of-sample 
validation.

## Non Seasonal
Stock market, a very unpredictable sector of finance, involves a large number of 
investors, buyers and sellers. Stock prediction has been a phenomenon since 
machine learning was introduced. But very few techniques became useful for 
forecasting the stock market as it changes with the passage of time. As time is 
playing a crucial rule here, Time Series (TS) analysis is used in this paper to 
predict short-term stock market. The first step for analyzing TS is to check whether 
historical stock market data is stationary using Plotting Rolling Statistics and 
Dickey-Fuller Test. Secondly, Trend and Seasonality is eliminated from the series 
to make the data a stationary series. Then, TS stochastic model known as 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is used as it has been 
broadly applied in financial and economic sectors for its efficiency and great 
potentiality for short-term stock market prediction. For comparing the 
performance, the three subclasses of ARIMA such as: Autoregressive (AR),
Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) are also 
applied. Finally, the forecasted values are converted to the original scale by 
applying Trend and Seasonality constraints back.
